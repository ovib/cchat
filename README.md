# cchat
Simple text-based messaging system inspired by IRC.

This project is the solution of Lab 2 of course TDA384 / DIT391 Principles of Concurrent Programming.

Developed and tested on Ubuntu 20.04 with Erlang installed with
 ```
 sudo apt-get install erlang
 ```
At the time of writing this command installs Erlang/OTP 22 [erts-10.6.4].

**Note that GUI libraries are not working when installing Erlang from deb packages provided by the official website!**
